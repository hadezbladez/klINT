////postgreSQL confusion && learning
1. how to activate the server
    - we need to start them from services
    - look 4 "postgresql-x64-14"
    - then you can start it
    - without it database on pgadmin 4 it wont work
2. about more on CMD psql connect
    psql -h localhost -p 9798 -U postgres
    psql -h localhost -p 9798 -U appl_data -d Tester
    psql -h localhost -p 9798 -U appl_user -d acdb

//cheat sheet of cmd line

3. current username and password for locals
id = appl_data
pw = appl123

4. learning postgresql
we can import and export content
we can make user and grant a user for that database


////mysql confusion
1. you need to use xampp to work with
    without it we dont know what database to work with
2. local dont use username and password
