////----step by steps
theres many thing we should need to check on
1. check setup that is for routes
>> GSDAM
    it always the central for all thing like doing require() for content | its for not making mess of a thing
>> www
    you might be need to setup www for more utilities to use like
    file transfering, logging, environment-test, configuring front-end style, Etc
>> WebRoute.js
    then you put some new utilities in here. 
    backend content lock mechanism
    
2. Check and setup some routes
>> check up front-end web pages design like
    some of the style might be different like
    partial and using layouts

    

>> setup somes CRUD style (post, get, put, delete) / http methods to fix APIs
    fixing routing page using next to check the cookies, session and any other useful identification
    file transfering like download and upload things using [multer] npm-plugin
    checking database content

3. customizing about concept folder
this is the content that you can set up for routing on backend or frontend doesnt matter
some setup might be different if some content use client-server services
>> views
    using express-ejs-layout so there r 4 keypoint : 
        - layout-core, layout-partial, page-core, page-partial
        - other stuff(left-over stuff) = default-error, lo-learn, lo-other
>> public
    its content for static things that you found on internet or you create your own logics
    there r 3 keypoint : core (page script), self (customized content(script, style, file, etc) ), vendor (stealin content from net)
>> models
    its 4 backend connection with database


////----additional infos
//idea of layouting
there will be multiple layout that just different about their style, script, layouts || its not exactly like that (thank god!)
layout >> we can include the fuck we want
partials >> theres three different parts that we will have it
    body, style, script

its only their parts are differents



////----error or faulty content
1. weird first activatation apps
weird startup? cache stucking? etag error?
something kinda start error-bug layouting? we need to try again for next time
